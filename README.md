# 🧹 ClearView  
### *AI Software Lifecycle Cleaner*  
**Built for the BNY Mellon Hackathon — Best AI Hack | Best App | Auritas Data Viz | Snowflake**

---

## 💡 Overview  
**ClearView** is an AI-powered web application that intelligently cleans and analyzes messy software inventory data, giving organizations instant visibility into their technology lifecycle.  

Upload a CSV or text export of software assets, and ClearView will:  
- 🧠 **Normalize** vendor, product, and version names using the **Gemini API**  
- ⏳ **Predict** End-of-Support (EOS) dates using rule-based logic or a reference dataset  
- 📊 **Visualize** lifecycle health and risk through an interactive dashboard  
- 💾 **Export** a fully cleaned dataset ready for audits and compliance reports  

> ClearView helps IT and compliance teams quickly identify outdated or high-risk software — saving hours of manual data cleanup.

## 🧠 Why It Stands Out  
- ⚙️ **AI Automation:** Gemini AI intelligently standardizes inconsistent data  
- 📈 **Insightful Dashboards:** Real-time lifecycle KPIs and risk breakdowns  
- 💻 **Lightweight & Local:** Works fully offline with no external dependencies  
- 🚀 **Hackathon-Ready:** Fully buildable and demoable in under 10 hours
