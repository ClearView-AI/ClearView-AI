# State Management Fix - Complete Compute EOS Workflow

## Summary
Fixed state management issues preventing the complete workflow of "Upload → Normalize → Back → Compute EOS" from working correctly, and resolved missing AI prediction indicators (sparkles) in the table.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. State Persistence Issue
**Problem**: When navigating back from the Normalize Preview to Dashboard, the file name and normalized data state were not persisted, causing the "Compute EOS" button to be disabled.

**Solution**:
- Added `fileName` state in `App.jsx` to persist across navigation
- Updated `UploadPanel` to accept `fileName` and `hasNormalizedData` props
- Fixed "Compute EOS" button disabled logic

**Commit**: 93a73da

### 2. Missing AI Prediction Indicators
**Problem**: The sparkles ✨ icons were not showing next to AI-predicted EOS dates.

**Root Cause**: The `tableData` mapping was creating new objects excluding AI fields (eosPredicted, eosConfidence, eosSource, eosReasoning).

**Solution**: Changed mapping to use spread operator to preserve all fields.
